      <description>Paper review: (What’s in a Name? Reducing Bias in Bios Without Access to Protected Attributes)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05233]
Overall, I have a negative opinion of this paper. It introduces a novel way of bias mitigation, but provides little theoretical justification for why such an approach is useful, and also does not compare their work with any previous work. More over, I am extremely skeptical of the entire point of their paper, which is that we do not have access to protected attributes and so should find a way of providing fairness without looking at protected attributes.</description>
