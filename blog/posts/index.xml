      <description>What exactly is the value prop of this blog? Well I like to think that I have some interesting things going on in my life:
 Machine learning, deep learning, linear algebra, statistics. I am a student in deep learning, and am lucky enough to be exposed daily to the inspirational and amazing work being conducted in the U of T ML group, at Vector Institute. In particular, I want to talk about the awesome papers and concepts I learn about in CSC2547 and CSC2541 My research: to appear in ACL 2020 (fingers crossed!</description>

  In short:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally set up the Hugo blog subsite on my personal github site, so here is the obligatory &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo;
Current thoughts about Hugo: Neat, but probably would have been better served by a more established/feature-rich system like Jekyll or perhaps Gatsby!
In particular: I have concerns about dating/naming of posts, especially as this list grows (hopefully) long!</description>
