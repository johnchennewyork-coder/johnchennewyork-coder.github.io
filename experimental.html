    Under construction, kinda

 	Open research questions and interesting problems:
 <ol>
 	<li>
 		Deriving linear and logistic regression from scratch. Starting with the normal equation, and simply trying to estimate the coefficients. And Gaussian assumption the errors. 
 	</li>
 	 	<li>
 		More to be added (in particular, things that come up during the fairness or word level modelling)
 	</li>
 	 	<li>
 	 		Putting the CRF on top of the final layer
 	</li>
 </ol>
